				<h1>David Martinez</h1>
				<p>David is HydroBurst’s team leader. Ever since he joined a robotics club in high school he became fascinated by the merits of engineering design and the computer programming involved to control those systems. Today he is attending the University of Houston majoring in Mechanical Engineering Technology and Computer Science minoring in Mathematics and Petroleum Technology. David is excited for the 2016 MATE competition so he can use his skills in programming and design to develop the control systems of his team’s underwater ROV.</p>
